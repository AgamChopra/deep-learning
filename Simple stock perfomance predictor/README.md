# Simple Stock Performance
Simple Stock Performance Predictor is a deep learning model developed to predict whether one should invest and hold a given stock for a year or not for profit.

## Disclosure
This is my first attempt to make a deep learning algorithm in python using NumPy.
As part of my MBA program at Stevens Institute of Technology, I developed this model for one of my Business Information Analysis class in Fall 2020.

I utilized a simplified and idealized data set to show that ANN can be used to predict future stock performance based on financial indicators from tax returns, the economy, and the happiness index of a country.

**Please note that this is a simple model to ONLY achieve my class's data analysis requirements. It is my recommendation that further research be done before utilizing similar models for real world applications.**
