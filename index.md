# Agam Chopra's Deep Learning and Data Science repository

## What is the Deep Learning repository about?

["Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)

This repo is a collection of all my publicly available Deep Learning projects. Please feel free to fork and program your versions of the code.

## Projects in this repository

* [X-Ray Pneumonia diagnostic CNN](https://github.com/AgamChopra/deep-learning/tree/master/X-Ray%20Pneumonia%20diagnostic%20CNN) The goal of this project is to develop a Convolutional neural network that can accurately diagnose a patient with Pneumonia and the type of Pneumonia(viral or bacterial) by analyzing the patientâ€™s chest X-ray image. ResNet50 architecture gave test accuracy of 1.00 and Val accuracy of 0.98.

* [Simple Stock Perfomance](https://github.com/AgamChopra/deep-learning/tree/master/Simple%20stock%20perfomance%20predictor) Predictor is a deep learning model developed to predict whether one should invest and hold a given stock for a year or not for profit.

* I have created a visualization of all the activation functions and their first derivatives that I am familiar with using the Desmos graphing tool [click here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/altncvpktu).
