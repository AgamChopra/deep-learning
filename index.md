# Agam Chopra's Deep Learning and Data Science repository

## What is the Deep Learning repository about?

["Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)

This repo is a collection of all my publicly available Deep Learning projects. Please feel free to fork and program your versions of the code.

## Projects in this repository

* [Simple Stock Perfomance](https://github.com/AgamChopra/deep-learning/tree/master/Simple%20stock%20perfomance%20predictor)

* I have created a visualization of all the activation functions and their first derivatives that I am familiar with using the Desmos graphing tool [click here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/altncvpktu).

## Skills Utilized
In this project, I utilized the following skills: 

* [ADAM optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf)

* [Learning rate decay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01878.pdf)

* [Input normalization](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-data-should-be-normalized-before-training-a-neural-network-c626b7f66c7d)

* [Swish over LeakyReLU](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.05941.pdf)[ activation function](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02671.pdf)

* [Vectorization](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-vectorization-in-machine-learning-6c7be3e4440a)

* [Data Visualization](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-data-visualization-in-python-89a54c97fbed)

* [Decision threshold optimization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/threshold-moving-for-imbalanced-classification/)

* [Random initialization](https://towardsdatascience.com/weight-initialization-techniques-in-neural-networks-26c649eb3b78)

### Useful resources:

* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielson](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) is a free online book and a great resource to gain intuition about Deep Learning.

* I also recommend enrolling in the [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?utm_source=deeplearningai&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=WebsiteCoursesDLSTopButton)
