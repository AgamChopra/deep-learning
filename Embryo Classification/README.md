# Embryo Classification

The goal of this project is to correctly classify embryo viability based on a 2D microscope image of the embryo.

## Embryo Grading

The dataset was collected from Kaggle and manually graded by [Ilka Lorenzo](https://agamchopra.github.io/ilka.html).

This was then used to train a fully convolutional neural network to give a decent prediction given the low sample set.

*NOTE: For cases like this, transferred learning might be very useful but for the scope of this project, it seemed unnecessary to pursue it.*
